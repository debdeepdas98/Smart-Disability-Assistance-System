# Smart-Disability-Assistance-System
PROJECT TITLE
SMART VISUAL COGNITIVE SOLUTION FOR DISABILITY ASSISTANCE SYSTEM THROUGH DEEP LEARNING AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Visual cognition is combining visual data with prior knowledge which constructs high-level representations and make unconscious decisions about the content in the scene. The project aims to provide a solution for visually challenged people to provide an assistance while ambulating by analysing the scene and sending them audio signals that warn them about any moving or stationary object that comes in their path.
